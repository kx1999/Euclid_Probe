## Necessary changes 
Requires no hardware changes from the original mod *unless you plan to use* **VoronGantryMount2_Bkt_whoppingpochard.stl**, which is used for the gantry-mounted dock options.

[Gantry Dock](https://euclidprobe.github.io/02c_Voron2.html#gantry-dock--mount) and [90 Degree Gantry Dock](https://euclidprobe.github.io/02c_Voron2.html#90-degree-gantry-dock--mount)

If you want to use one of these style docks, use M5X12 screws instead of the M5X16 screws that the original Euclid probe dock recommends.

## Other files
Contains only the modified parts. Use the original files from the appropriate dock for the rest of the assembly.
