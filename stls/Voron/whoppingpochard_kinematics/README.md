# Modified Euclid Probe dock parts to use with whoppingpochard's kinematic bed mounts
This fork contains modified parts that add 8mm of z-height to the probe dock to match the 8mm added by whoppingpochard's kinematic bed mounts.

## Necessary changes 
Requires no hardware changes from the original Euclid probe docks *unless you plan to use* **VoronGantryMount2_Bkt_whoppingpochard.stl**, which is corresponds to the gantry-mounted dock options.

[Gantry Dock](https://euclidprobe.github.io/02c_Voron2.html#gantry-dock--mount) and [90 Degree Gantry Dock](https://euclidprobe.github.io/02c_Voron2.html#90-degree-gantry-dock--mount)

If you want to use one of these style docks, use M5X12 screws instead of the M5X16 screws that the original Euclid probe dock recommends.

## Other files
Contains only the modified parts. Use the original files of the appropriate dock for the rest of the assembly.
