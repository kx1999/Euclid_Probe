# Modified Euclid Probe Bed-Rail Mounted Dock part to use with whoppingpochard's kinematic bed mounts
This fork contains a modified bed-rail mounted dock that add 8mm of z-height to the probe dock to match the 8mm added by whoppingpochard's kinematic bed mounts.

Using the gantry-mounted docks requires no changes as the probe will still need to be at the same z-height relative to the toolhead no matter how tall your bed is. Ensure that your z-endstop is extended by 8mm and working properly.

## Necessary changes 
Requires no hardware changes from the original dock.
